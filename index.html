            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Absolutely love listening to music, and honestly, I can't imagine what I'd do without it. Whenever I'm feeling sad, stressed, or frustrated, music has this amazing ability to help me calm down and put my mind at ease. It’s like a soothing escape for me. Whether it's a song that makes me feel understood or just one that lifts my mood, I always find comfort in it. Every song I come across, if I find it enjoyable, becomes a way for me to release tension and regain my sense of balance. Music, in a way, has become a constant companion that helps me navigate through difficult moments.

            <h2>Friends</h2>
            <p>Friendship is founded on mutual affection, respect, and trust. They are people we can trust, share our ideas and experiences with, and enjoy spending time with. Unlike family, friendships are formed through choice and shared interests, making them distinct and often very meaningful.

                Good friends help one another through both good and terrible times. They celebrate your accomplishments, offer consolation during difficult times, and give you a sense of belonging. Friendships are formed on values such as honesty, loyalty, kindness, and empathy. A friendship's strength is often found in the capacity to be yourself around someone without criticism while also feeling understood and loved.</p>
